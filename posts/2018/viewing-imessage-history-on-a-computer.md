I occasionally want to go back and browse conversations I‚Äôve had, either to lookup some detail or to revisit a discussion (many of which might become future blog posts üôÉ). Aside from work Slack, the vast majority of my conversations are through iMessages, but Apple‚Äôs apps don‚Äôt make it easy to scroll through history. I figured it would be fun to write my own. The first version is the equivalent of one day‚Äôs work, and [everything is available on Github](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser).

The rest of this post will walk through the code and my thought process as I went along. When I was learning to program, I would come often across projects where I didn‚Äôt know enough to begin to understand how I might build something similar, and I wished that the author would have explained the thoughts that took them from A‚ÄìZ. This is the sort of guide I would‚Äôve wanted to read.

# Sketches

Since I‚Äôm building this project for myself, I started by defining some criteria:

* It should be really easy to build. I wanted this to take about a day, not drag out over weeks or months.
* A web UI would be much easier to build than a native UI.
* I write a lot of Javascript at work, and I wanted a break from JS ‚Äî this project should have as little JS/frontend scripting as possible.
* I wanted to play around more with [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) (a programming language).
* The interface could be bare-bones, since it was more important to me that I finish quickly than make something beautiful.
* I wanted the product to behave in a way that‚Äôs ‚Äúnative‚Äù and familiar to me. In particular, that meant that
	* Links should load immediately
	* Back and Forward should work
	* I could use Cmd+F to quickly find anything. This also meant that I wanted all messages to be on one page, rather than have pagination.
	* I wanted to be able to use the arrow keys, spacebar, and Page Up/Page Down keys to scroll the messages (not the list of messages), since most of my use case would be reading the messages in a particular conversation.
	* I should be able to link to any conversation or specific message.

I started with both technical criteria and user-experience criteria. Since this is a project for myself, and partly intended as a technical exercise, it‚Äôs roughly a 50/50 split. If you were building a robust product for other users, the user-experience criteria would probably comprise most of the requirements. If you were building a technical proof-of-concept, the technical criteria would dominate (although it‚Äôs still important to consider how other developers might use it ‚Äî what you might call the _developer experience_).

I also drew a rough sketch to offload my interface ideas from my working memory.

# Loading a list of conversations

[View on Github](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/commit/79c8f92c6dd8beb8c9e2350af9c5dfb16cf2eca4)

I started by loading all my conversations. This simple step helps me build momentum, and is directly useful.

From prior experience, I knew that my messages were saved in a SQLite database at `~/Library/Messages/chat.db` (this is also easily Googlable). I decided to [copy this file](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/blob/79c8f92c6dd8beb8c9e2350af9c5dfb16cf2eca4/src/messages_browser/database.cr#L10-L11) to a temporary location when running my app so I could avoid any accidental data damage. I was also concerned that read locking might be an issue, but that [doesn‚Äôt appear to be a problem](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10618830/472768).

Since messages are stored in a SQLite file, loading a list of conversations meant making a SQL query and loading the results into some data structures. Crystal is an object-oriented language, so I started by figuring out what objects I wanted to have; at this point I wasn‚Äôt concerned with the fields or methods they would have.

The models (`Chat` and `User`) were obvious. Besides that, I knew I wanted a place to put all the code involved in actually working with the database ‚Äî opening the file, executing a query, and cleanup (closing the file). In OOP design, ‚Äúa place to put code‚Äù is often an object ‚Äî hence the `Database` class. Similarly, I wanted a place to put the SQL query (hence `Queries::AllChats`), and a place to put the code that would run the SQL and instantiate my models (hence `ORM::Chats`). The module namespacing isn‚Äôt required, but I find it helpful to organize my code.

Arguably, a class to manage a SQL query could be considered unnecessary; a SQL query is simply a string. However, developers tend to think of a SQL query in more structured terms ‚Äî selecting _a set of fields_ from _some (joined) tables_, possibly with a `WHERE` criteria or a _sort order_. Creating a class allowed me to break apart these components, and, in my opinion, improves developer ergonomics. If I wanted to change the selected fields, it‚Äôs much easier to edit a method than to fiddle around with a string.


```
# View raw: https://gist.github.com/feifanzhou/cc97abcfcc3a4206caa2e740c6b2864f

module Queries
  struct AllChats
    # Table aliases:
    #   C => chat
    #   CHJ => chat_handle_join
    #   H => handle

    def sql
      "#{select_clause} #{from_clause};"
    end

    def read_types
      {
        row_id:          Int32,
        chat_identifier: String,
        service_name:    String,
        handle_id:       String,
      }
    end

    private def fields
      %w[
        C.ROWID
        C.chat_identifier
        C.service_name
        H.id
      ]
    end

    private def select_clause
      "SELECT #{fields.join(", ")}"
    end

    private def from_clause
      "FROM chat C " \
      "JOIN chat_handle_join CHJ ON C.ROWID = CHJ.chat_id " \
      "JOIN handle H ON CHJ.handle_id = H.ROWID"
    end
  end
end
```

A nice benefit is that there‚Äôs now an obvious place to define the expected types that I‚Äôll get back from the database.

To determine the query itself, I used [SQLite Browser](http://sqlitebrowser.org/) to look at the data and schema. It includes a REPL which allows me to quickly try queries until I got the results that I was looking for.

> Being able to run code and see the results rapidly is crucial to effectively writing software.

![SQL REPL in SQLite Browser](https://files.tanagram.app/file/tanagram-data/prod-feifans-blog/imessage-history-2.png)

In practice, I started by looking at the structure of the tables and browsed the data to get a sense of what the data looked like ‚Äî how did they store phone numbers? Were IDs integers, UUIDs, or something else?

The aptly-named `chat` table looked promising, and contained almost everything I was looking for. However, it wasn‚Äôt a perfect data source for the phone number or email of the people I was chatting with:

* The GUID column contained values like `iMessage;-;+15551234567`, but I didn‚Äôt want to do string manipulation on this value because I didn‚Äôt want to rely on the format of the string. Generally, when working with someone else‚Äôs system, it‚Äôs a good practice to treat ID strings as opaque, rather than trying to decipher their internal structure.
* The `chat_identifier` column had useful values most of the time, except for group conversations where it contained an auto-generated value like `chat86732149616291698` (this was also present in the `GUID`).

Fortunately, when I began this project, I had been googling for some background on working with iMessages data, and came across [Steven Morse‚Äôs article](https://stmorse.github.io/journal/iMessage.html) which started with the `handle` table. This table contained the specific phone number or email for everyone I‚Äôve messaged, and the aptly named `chat_handle_join` table brought them together. A couple of REPL iterations later (it took me a few tries to figure out which columns were the relevant foreign keys), I had a working SQL query.

`chat_handle_join` is a _SQL join table_; join tables are used to implement one-to-many or many-to-many relationships. For example, one chat can have many handles if it‚Äôs a group chat. The `chat` table has one row for the chat, the `handle` table has one row for each handle, and the `chat_handle_join` table has one row for each handle with a corresponding chat ID.

Turning chat handles into contact names will be covered a few sections below.

Finally, I added [some code](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/blob/79c8f92c6dd8beb8c9e2350af9c5dfb16cf2eca4/src/messages_browser.cr) that would run everything and output the intended result: a list of `Chat` objects. This allowed me to setup a rapid feedback loop for my app code ‚Äî I kept a Terminal tab with `crystal src/messages_browser.cr` in the history, and every time I made a change, I brought up that command and ran it.

# Loading messages in a conversation

[View on Github](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/commit/5e587ce66c1d6c85580f8fb58c139305d5aa6ed8)

This step followed the same thought process as the last step. The `message` table data looked promising. Following the same pattern as the handles above, the `chat_message_join` table handled the one-to-many relationship between a chat and its messages. `message.handle_id` pointed to a `handle`, representing the message sender. Conveniently, `message.is_from_me` made it easy to identify ‚Äúmy‚Äù messages and display them accordingly.

However, the dates on each message looked unusual to me, and I spent a while figuring out how to work with those values. The `date` column contained values like `530402579000000000`. All the dates ended in 9 zeros, so when playing around with the value, I started by dividing them all by a billion. Comparing dates on two messages to known timestamps (mousing over the corresponding messages in the Mac app), the  numbers (sans zeros) corresponded to seconds, but they didn‚Äôt look like Unix timestamps which, for recent memory, started with a `1`. Fortunately, I did some iOS programming years ago, and remembered that some of Apple‚Äôs API use midnight on January 1st, 2001 as an epoch time. That time translates to `978307200` seconds after the UNIX epoch (January 1st, 1970), and adding this number to the date value resulted in a timestamp I could [work with](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/blob/5e587ce66c1d6c85580f8fb58c139305d5aa6ed8/src/messages_browser/time.cr).

I probably could‚Äôve done this transformation in the SQL query, giving my app nice numbers back. But I didn‚Äôt, because:

* I‚Äôm not very familiar with the SQL syntax for doing so, which would‚Äôve made the code more likely to have a bug and be harder to maintain.
* Similarly, it‚Äôs easier to have that code in app-code. For example, the transformation is more reusable ‚Äî by adding the method to the built-in `Time` class, I can use it anywhere else timestamps like this are stored. If this was a team project, it makes it easier for other team members to work with because they won‚Äôt have to work with the relevant SQL as well as the app code that they already have to understand.
* In a production environment, app code typically scales better than database code. App code can scale horizontally (adding more servers) or vertically (using beefier servers); scaling a database generally isn‚Äôt as easy. It‚Äôs not a real issue for a project like this, but I think it‚Äôs still a relevant ‚Äúbest practice‚Äù.

# Rendering UI

[View on Github](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/commit/95296cf81297e8ce688dc1a0da3101b31f6d2fe6)

Once I had the data I needed, I could start building my UI. I decided to use [Kemal](http://kemalcr.com/) for its simplicity. Intuitively, I only needed two pages ‚Äî one to list my chats, and one to list the messages for each chat. With the `Database` class encapsulating all access to the database, the app server was really simple:

```
# View raw: https://gist.github.com/feifanzhou/ed5a462598daa9231b832c44262a21e1

require "kemal"
require "./*"

print "Starting‚Ä¶\n"
print "Opening database‚Ä¶\r"
db = Database.new
print "\e[KDatabase ready\n"

get "/" do
  chats = db.all_chats
  render "src/views/index.ecr", "src/views/layout.ecr"
end

get "/chat/:chat_id" do |env|
  chats = db.all_chats
  chat_id = env.params.url["chat_id"].try(&.to_i)
  messages = db.chat_messages(chat_id)
  render "src/views/messages.ecr", "src/views/layout.ecr"
end

Kemal.run
```

The `print` statements aren‚Äôt strictly necessary, but it adds a nice touch to the user experience when starting the app, especially if it takes a moment to load the database.

As for the output syntax: `\n` prints a line break. `\r` is a carriage return ‚Äî it moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line, so any subsequent print output would overwrite the current line. `\e[K` is a [Bash control character that clears the current line](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2388090/how-to-delete-and-replace-last-line-in-the-terminal-using-bash#comment11362306_6774395) first.

The views themselves are straightforward ‚Äî they iterate over `chats` and `messages` respectively and output a DOM element for each. The messages page also includes the list of chats; I didn‚Äôt find any apparent solution to avoid duplicating the view code there, but I could live with a few copy-and-pasted lines.

The only interesting thing in the CSS is [creating a separate scroll container for the chats list](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/blob/95296cf81297e8ce688dc1a0da3101b31f6d2fe6/public/index.css#L12-L21), which allows keyboard scroll commands (spacebar, arrow keys, Page Up/Page Down) to scroll the messages list.

A few UI tweaks followed: [adding timestamps](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/commit/65e6c032de4013c11fe5474d7b27f675abca2831), making it easier to visually browse messages; [changing the color of the messages I sent](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/commit/58d7927c25496bfff622832e3612fcd9ef42de38) to make it easier to read the conversation (bubbles would‚Äôve been too fancy); [highlighting the currently selected chat](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/commit/e05b1119842db9d13963894d5b5f909f788d46e0) in the chats list; and [escaping message text](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/commit/001a1d0ffbb3682e5638f9850f51d5622e2b9058) (which I only remembered because I noticed some messages rendering strangely as a result of a literal `<div>` I‚Äôd written in the original message text). These changes aren‚Äôt very interesting.

# Displaying contacts names

[View on Github](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/commit/6abd398a8d84ab12d96646d59bea3916dde2b373) (this commit also contains changes for attachments, covered below. Sorry for the Git sloppiness).

This was the hardest part of the project. iMessages doesn‚Äôt know anything about contacts‚Äô names; that‚Äôs managed by the OS‚Äô `AddressBook` framework and the Contacts app. I figured the underlaying data was likely stored in a SQLite database somewhere. I had a little difficulty finding it, but some Googling revealed that the database was in `~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook`. One twist from many of the existing articles was that, because I sync my contacts through iCloud, I had a `Sources` folder with two subfolders (labelled by UUIDs), one of which corresponded to my ‚ÄúOn My Mac‚Äù contacts, and the other with my iCloud-synced contacts. The filename is `AddressBook-v22.abcddb` in both folders, and it‚Äôs a SQLite database. Rather than worrying about how to determine the relevant source UUID, I just [loaded all the databases](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/blob/6abd398a8d84ab12d96646d59bea3916dde2b373/src/contacts.cr#L16-L17).

At first, looking at the data in SQLite browser, I wasn‚Äôt clear how the schema worked. I then considered working with the native macOS `AddressBook.framework` ‚Äî preferably a low-level C version, which would be easier to [bind in Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/syntax_and_semantics/c_bindings/). However, a lack of relevant documentation (and seeing the [amount of boilerplate needed](https://github.com/manastech/crocoa) to work with `Foundation` and `CoreFoundation` data types) made that approach seem like a bad idea.

Luckily, I stumbled across an [old Macworld article](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20100130052524548) containing SQL code to search the database. The code still works, and revealed enough about the database schema for me to figure out the query I needed to return a contact‚Äôs name given an email or phone. A couple of iterations in SQLite Browser later, I had [the query I needed](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/blob/6abd398a8d84ab12d96646d59bea3916dde2b373/src/queries/contacts.cr). I also created a [Contacts class](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/blob/6abd398a8d84ab12d96646d59bea3916dde2b373/src/contacts.cr), similar to the `Database` class, to manage access to this database.

I decided the simplest way to use it was to add a method to the `User` model, which I was already using in the [Message](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/blob/6abd398a8d84ab12d96646d59bea3916dde2b373/src/models/message.cr#L5) and [Chat](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/blob/6abd398a8d84ab12d96646d59bea3916dde2b373/src/models/chat.cr#L5) classes. This came from thinking about developer ergonomics ‚Äî any class that worked with `User`s don‚Äôt have to _also_ know about `Contacts`. For example, `Chat` could [implement `display_name`](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/blob/6abd398a8d84ab12d96646d59bea3916dde2b373/src/models/chat.cr#L15-L17) with a short, elegant `map` rather than having to know about how the Contacts class works. This is used when [rendering the list of chats](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/blob/6abd398a8d84ab12d96646d59bea3916dde2b373/src/views/messages.ecr#L5).

# Display attachments

[View on Github](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/commit/6abd398a8d84ab12d96646d59bea3916dde2b373)
 
Early on, I wondered how non-textual messages (photos, links, etc) were handled. I was reminded of this thought when I noticed some messages that had no text, and realized that attachments were the missing piece. I found [this article](http://linuxsleuthing.blogspot.com/2015/01/getting-attached-apple-messaging.html) (caution: slow site), which helped me understand the data schema. A message can have multiple attachments, and they‚Äôre linked via the `message_attachment_join` table.

I took the query that loaded messages, and [made some changes](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/commit/6abd398a8d84ab12d96646d59bea3916dde2b373#diff-e50e1caf19dbad4f7df681e04151f696) to also load attachments. My first attempt returned a few dozen rows for a conversation I knew had hundreds of messages. I realized I need a [`LEFT JOIN`](http://www.sql-join.com/sql-join-types/), which would include all rows from the `message` table (since it was on the ‚Äúleft‚Äù side of the join), even if it didn‚Äôt have any attachments. A plain `JOIN` [would‚Äôve been an `INNER JOIN`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/565640/472768), which only returns rows that have both a message and an attachment.

A join like that returns one row per message or attachment, which meant that for messages with multiple attachments, I‚Äôd get multiple rows for the same message. The code that creates `Message` instances [had to take that into account](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/commit/6abd398a8d84ab12d96646d59bea3916dde2b373#diff-cae727a06bad80585523fa004bc67bda) ‚Äî it keeps a hash of `Message` instances, keyed by its ID. If I came across a result row that referenced the same message, I‚Äôd [append the returned Attachment](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/commit/6abd398a8d84ab12d96646d59bea3916dde2b373#diff-cae727a06bad80585523fa004bc67bdaR41) to the Message. Otherwise, I‚Äôd [create a new Message](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/commit/6abd398a8d84ab12d96646d59bea3916dde2b373#diff-cae727a06bad80585523fa004bc67bdaR32) and add it to the hash. The method [returns the `values` in the hash](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/commit/6abd398a8d84ab12d96646d59bea3916dde2b373#diff-cae727a06bad80585523fa004bc67bdaR44) to keep its external API consistent.

The last interesting piece is the [`MessagePresenter class`](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser/blob/6abd398a8d84ab12d96646d59bea3916dde2b373/src/presenters/message_presenter.cr). Generally, a presenter is a class that translates from a data object to an output ‚Äî often to a JSON or HTML string. In this case, `MessagePresenter` is initialized with a `Message` and figures out the HTML output for the message‚Äôs contents. If it has attachments, the presenter returns some links; otherwise, it returns the (escaped) message text.

_(I‚Äôm a fan of the Presenter pattern. I‚Äôll probably write another post on their benefits and how we use them at work)._

# Wrapping up

All of the code is [available on Github](https://github.com/feifanzhou/messages-browser). The project does everything I need it do for now. I don‚Äôt feel compelled to constantly update it; it may be weeks, months, or years before I make any changes. Bugfixes notwithstanding, I consider it a v1 and done.

I wrote this post because it‚Äôs what I would‚Äôve wanted to read if I came across a project like this, made by someone else, and I didn‚Äôt know enough to build it myself. I‚Äôve read a lot of technical blogs that didn‚Äôt dive into the level of depth I craved, especially about specific implementation details, nuanced decisions, and the underlying thought process. As someone who‚Äôs relentlessly curious, I was (and continue to be) hungry for richly tactical explanations. This is an attempt to put something like that out there on a topic I now know a little about. I hope someone finds it useful.
