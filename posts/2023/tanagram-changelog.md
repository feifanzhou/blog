* This version adds (technically, fixes) support for Swift projects. It's not entirely automatic though; in this version, you'll have to manually create a compilation database. See the README for details.

* Hello World! This is the first release of Tanagram that's available outside of my personal computer. It may be slow, crashy, and/or not super-useful yet, but it's the start of a bunch of ideas that I'm really excited about for understanding and navigating medium-to-large codebases.
* Typescript/Javascript code has the best support in this version. Swift is partly supported. Ruby might work; I started by integrating Ruby support but haven't touched that integration in a long time.
* See the features guide for details on what this version can do.
* If you're seeing this, I want to talk to you, both to get your feedback on this build, as well as to understand how you typically navigate codebases and documentation. If I haven't reached out to you, please don't hesitate to [email me](mailto:feifan@tanagram.app) or DM me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/tanagram_).
